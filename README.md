# Overview

This web page displays a form to convert from one temperature to another. To do so, all that needs to be done is to type a number in the first text box, select the original temperature, select the temperature you wish to convert it to, and then hit convert. The converted temperature will display in the disabled text box.

The conversions are done using calculations that are coded into the page. Utilizing a decision structure, the code determines which temperatures have been selected and then uses the designated conversion formula.
